### 1. Creating your patrol

You can create a patrol after signing in the first time, or after clicking the patroller menu in the top right and selecting "New Patrol"

## 1. Name and Time Zone

Name your patrol and specify the local timezone for your patrol.  Note that times in patrol.ski are typically shown in the local timezone for the current users device.  Exceptions are when defining shift times and shift recurring work item times, which always use the patrol's local time.

## 2. Initial Setup

Initial setup provides some time saving functions to quickly create some things for your patrol.  
 - Default creates alpine ski and alpine snowboard training plans with user groups.
 - Empty creates nothing, you must create everything including new training plans.
 - Demo creates a new patrol with sample data for all functions.   This is helpful just to see how things work.

## 3. Functionality

Enable or disable each functionality for the patrol.  These may also be changed later on the patrol settings page.
